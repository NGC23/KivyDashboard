# Kivy Python Dashboard

Please note this is a first Poc Application built using KIVY and Python (First time building app in python - i have a lot to learn, please note i know that this is an expierement), this was purely for the love of programming and approaching KIVY application development much differently to the examples online where they use on file for all screens etc, here i try apply SOLID principles etc.


  - This is my first application built using kivy
  - This application consists of Authentication step that leads user to a dashboard
  - I have built a nav menu(widget) that i include throughout my application used for navigation purposes
  - Backend is Full blown Python : )


Here are some little screenshots, Please note this is the KivyMD theme and not basic Kivy - Please note the CRUD system for the food library is not functional, Authentication, routing etc is working
