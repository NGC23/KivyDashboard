# Kivy Python Dashboard

Please note this is a first Poc Application built using KIVY, this was purely for the love of programming and approaching KIVY application development much differently to the examples online where they use on file for all screens etc, here i try apply SOLID principles etc.


  - This is my first application built using kivy
  - This application consists of Authentication step that leads user to a dashboard
  - I have built a nav menu(widget) that i include throughout my application used for navigation purposes
  - Backend is Full blown Python : )
