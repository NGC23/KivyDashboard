# So this is basically the loading component for all the screens in the application for the screen manager
# With this we can load all our screens here in order, the clean way to do this is to create the,
# respective kv file in the domain with the controller file, model and the repo,
# Lets see if the approach works out for me

#:include app/Authentication/login/kv/login.kv
#:include app/Authentication/register/kv/register.kv
#:include app/Dashboard/kv/dashboard.kv
#:include app/Nutrition/kv/itemAdd.kv
#:include app/Nutrition/kv/foodDiary.kv
#:include app/Nav/nav.kv

# This is an example of an screen element, i prefer to do this this waym feels much cleaner, so for example, for this screen,
# i can create an kv file in the domain location, then import it using

    # This is settings for the screen itself
    BoxLayout:
        orientation: "vertical"

        # These are widgets that go into the screen
